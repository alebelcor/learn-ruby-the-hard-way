# Now write a game similar to the one that I created in the last exercise. It can be any kind of game you want in the same flavor. Spend a week on it making it as interesting as possible. For Study Drills, use arrays, functions, and modules (remember those from Exercise 13?) as much as possible, and find as many new pieces of Ruby as you can to make the game work.

# Before you start coding you must draw a map for your game. Create the rooms, monsters, and traps that the player must go through on paper before you code.

# Once you have your map, try to code it up. If you find problems with the map then adjust it and make the code match.
